# Random picture dog vs cat simulator
## just click fight, the pictures clash, and one wins. It's essentially just an rng game. I feel like there it was a more creative way to come up with a game mechanic, so I like the idea of revisting this, but for now, they just randomly win.
## rescources included past lectures, I used some past html code as a model for the design , as well as online rescources.
